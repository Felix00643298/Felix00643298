ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m @Felix00643298**  
ðŸ¤– I'm a **robotics engineer** by day, tinkering with algorithms, sensors, and motors, and a problem-solver by night, figuring out how to make robots smarter, faster, and more efficient!

ðŸ‘€ **Iâ€™m interested in**  
Building robots that can actually **think**, **feel**, and maybe one day even **make their own decisions** (but letâ€™s not get too crazy!). Iâ€™m particularly passionate about **robot perception**, **autonomous navigation**, and **human-robot interaction**. When I'm not busy with robotics, I love exploring the endless possibilities of **machine learning** and **AI**.

ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning**  
How to make robots not just follow orders, but **adapt** to new environments in real-time! I'm diving deep into **reinforcement learning**, **ROS 2** (because itâ€™s time to upgrade), and fine-tuning **vision-based systems**. If robots could go to school, Iâ€™d be their teacherâ€™s pet. ðŸ§ 

ðŸ’ž **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on**  
Cutting-edge **robotic projects** that push the boundaries of what's possible. Whether it's designing an **autonomous delivery robot**, **AGV navigation**, or creating the next-gen **robotic arm**, Iâ€™m all in. Oh, and I never say no to a good **hackathon**.

ðŸ“« **How to reach me**  
Drop me a line on GitHub or reach out via email. Letâ€™s build something amazing together!

ðŸ˜„ **Pronouns:** He/Him â€“ Unless my robot gets a mind of its own, then maybe they/Them.

âš¡ **Fun fact**:  
I once convinced a robot to play **Rock, Paper, Scissors** with me, and letâ€™s just say... it was **unpredictable**. (It always picks Rockâ€¦ whatâ€™s up with that?)
